    So, I saw the USB he left behind, and I, being the nosy scrub I am, took it and went home with it. Man, I viewed the weirdest Rated R pictures in there, all sorts of naked girls, guys, and probably a mix of both to be honest,
    what a weird kiddo he was collecting these. However, the weirdest part of all this was they weren't just random pictures, they were definitely from our school because I could swear I knew some of those kids were in the freshman class. Weird huh?
    I didn't pay too much attention to this, however perhaps I should've. I decided to throw away the USB, didn't really take any interest towards it. Next year, those 10 pictures on the USB, or those 10 people, were all found dead. To this day neither the murderer has been found, yet I still have Edwin on Facebook. Oh well.
