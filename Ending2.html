    I took this USB home, went ahead to pop the sucker into my computer, and bam, my computer just died. Must've been one of those USB Laptop killers, good thing this was my 150$ Chromebook, still made me mad enough to trace whose blood was on it though.
    That's exactly what I did, having a PhD in Biology can help at times, and one of thse fancy tech that traces the person. It was one of my old teacehers, so I figured it was theres. I called them, they never answered. Chills went on my back the next day as
    I learned my teacher was kidnapped. Maybe tracing somehow where this was sourced could've helped me find who it was, but I was too lazy. i just went to sleep. Years later I needed that USB again, and it never occurred to me but there was a name on that USB,
    it signed... Edwin...
