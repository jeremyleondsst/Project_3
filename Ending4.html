      I was too lazy to check the USB, so I just left it at school. Someone else must've been curious enough to check it however because the next day it was gone. Weird. Later that week I got a call to my house,
      it was just someone crying, so I hung up. Again, they called. Again  I hung up. The cops showed up to my house the following week, and they said I killed a whole family. Apparently my fatal flaw was leaving that USB,
      the kid someone plotted the whole thing to set me up. He had my finger prints all over it, pictures of victims, and he was related to the people who "I killed". He was called against me, and I tried explaining that it was his USB and he set me up,
      but in there... somehow he had a picture of me laying with the victims... I was tried and charged with the death penalty... man sometimes livnig in Africa sucks.
