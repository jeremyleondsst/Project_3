  There was a kid, quite a shy fellow in my opinion, his name was Edwin. See, the interesting thing about Edwin here, is that he was different. Different how so? I'm not too sure,
  perhaps his gestures, his absurd abscences, or perhaps ugliness is what made me opiniate this. Quite frankly I never really knew him, however one day walking down the hallway, I saw him holding a bag,
  a rawr xd looking bag mind you, and I questioned him. Why? Again, beats me. I just did. He told me, on this day, that it all changes with this bag. And with that, he left. I never heard from him again, but he did leave behind something,
  a USB.
